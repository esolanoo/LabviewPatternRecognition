# LabviewPatternRecognition
Labview G code designed for National Intruments DAQ adquisition card.
A complete and robust code consisting of a Neural Network of a with 2 hidden layer of N and M nodes that receives an image and outputs the correct classification of the pattern in the image.
The code includes a perdeptron algorithm to train the Neural Network to identify all the desired patterns.
It analysies the image whi the built-in NI library of Data Vision
